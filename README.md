Pull data about Places from the Factual API

Example pulling data from Factual API (restaurant table) - list of restaurant from 50 US cities.

* This is a work in progress. Other than retrieving the data, the grand vision is figuring out how to make it useful.
* Needless to say, this code is FREE (as in Free Beer), just be sure to give proper attribution to me
* When pulling data from Factual.com, read and abide by the Terms of Services on their site
